# DeFeed

## Social Problem

Shortage of supplies such as oxygen and Remdesivir vials during COVID-19 pandemic lead to a nation-wide despair. Also, an overwhelming number of people are finding their treatment costs exceeding their saving amounts.
Through blockchain we are enabling the community to support itself by raising donations and by directly exchanging necessary COVID supplies without any intermediary service provider which reduces the time wastage and increased prices, and helps people get the "uncut" help.

## DeFeed

- DeFeed is a decentralized social networking site which is created with the aim to provide relief to people affected by Covid-19.
- We provide people with a platform to share posts and raise needful donations for the treatment of their loved ones and themselves.
- Other users can choose which post(s) they want to donate to.
- The page is live updated with the post with most donations always on the top.
- The platform also provides a medium for users to provide other users with supplies that they might want to sell for a minimum amount in ether. The user is asked to upload an image of the item, name, his phone number and the selling price in ether.
